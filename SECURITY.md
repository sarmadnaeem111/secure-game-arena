# Security Documentation for PUBG Tournaments Web Application

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the PUBG Tournaments web application to protect user data, prevent common web vulnerabilities, and ensure secure authentication and authorization.

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user authentication with email/password and Google OAuth 2.0
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels for users and administrators
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeout after inactivity
- **Account Lockout**: Temporary lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements and secure password reset flow
- **Email Verification**: Verification required for new accounts
- **OAuth 2.0 Integration**: Secure third-party authentication with Google

### Data Protection

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **Data Validation**: Client and server-side validation of all data
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted local storage for sensitive client-side data
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery

### Web Security

- **Content Security Policy**: Restricts sources of executable scripts
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional layer of XSS protection
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications are encrypted using TLS
- **Secure Cookies**: HTTP-only and secure flags set on cookies

## Authentication Methods

### Email/Password Authentication

- Strong password requirements enforced
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Secure password reset flow with expiring tokens
- Email verification required for new accounts

### Google Authentication

- OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure authentication
- Limited scope permissions requested
- State parameter validation to prevent CSRF attacks
- Secure token handling and validation
- User profile data securely stored in Firestore
- Seamless integration with existing user accounts
- Profile information synchronized with Firestore user documents
- CSRF protection integrated with Google authentication flow
- Consistent session management with email/password authentication

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Always use the AuthContext**: Never implement direct authentication logic
2. **Sanitize all inputs**: Use the provided security utilities
3. **Validate permissions**: Check user roles before performing sensitive operations
4. **Protect routes**: Use ProtectedRoute components for authenticated pages
5. **Handle errors securely**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages
6. **Follow the principle of least privilege**: Only request necessary permissions
7. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update npm packages
8. **Run security audits**: Use the provided security audit scripts

## Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by sending an email to security@pubgtournaments.com. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed by our team.

## Regular Security Audits

The application undergoes regular security audits using automated tools and manual code reviews. Run the security audit script with:

```bash
npm run security-audit
```

This will check for common security issues in the codebase and dependencies.
